# GPTstatus

A browser extension that changes its icon depending on the status of ChatGPT.

## Description

Have you ever opened up ChatGPT, only for it to not work, only for you to try prompting again or then maybe refreshing and then searching if it's down and finally realizing that it's down for everyone? Well, now you can know beforehand! With GPTstatus, you can know for sure if ChatGPT is down or not _before_ you try it.

And guess what. When ChatGPT isn't down, it functions as a handy little shortcut button to open up ChatGPT quickly and easily. If you already have an open tab buried in your tab bar, it'll take you there instead of opening a whole new tab for minimum tab clutter!

If you're already on the ChatGPT tab, clicking the toolbar icon will open a panel with more details.

Pretty cool, huh?
